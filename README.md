# Introduction to Python
Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. 
Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently. 
its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code. 

## Comments 

Comments in Python are used to provide explanations or annotations within your code. 
They are not executed by the Python interpreter and are meant to be human-readable.

##Single-Line Comments: Single-line comments are used for short comments and are preceded by the # symbol.
Everything on the same line after # is considered a comment and is ignored by the Python interpreter. 

This is a single-line comment 
```
 print("Hello, World")  This comment is at the end of a line of code
 
```
 
## Multi-Line Comments or Docstrings: Multi-line comments are typically used for longer explanations and documentation. 
In Python, these are often represented as docstrings (used for documentation of functions, classes, and modules).
A docstring is enclosed in triple quotes (''' or """) and can span multiple lines

```
This is a multi-line comment or a docstring.
It can span multiple lines and is often used for documenting functions, classes, or modules.

def my_function():
    """
    This is also a docstring.
    It provides documentation for the function.
     """"
    pass
```
# Introduction to Variables

Variables are simple containers for storing data values and Python has no commands for declaring a variable. 

1. ## Variable Naming Rules: 

Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning "myVariable" and "myvariable" are treated as different variables. 

Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_) character. 

Subsequent characters in variable names can include letters, digits (0-9), and underscores. 

Variable names cannot contain spaces or special characters like @, $, %, etc. 

2. ## Variable Assignment: 

Assigning a value to a variable is known as variable assignment. In Python, you use the = operator for assignment. 

For example, to assign the integer value 10 to a variable called "x," you would write: x = 10. 

3. ## Data Types: 

Variables have associated data types that define the kind of data they can hold. Common data types include: 

Integers (int): Whole numbers, e.g., 5, -3, 1000. 

Floating-point numbers (float): Decimal numbers, e.g., 3.14, -0.5, 2.0. 

Strings (str): Text, e.g., "Hello, World!". 

Booleans (bool): True or False. 

 

4. ## Variable Usage: 

Once a value is assigned to a variable, you can use that variable in expressions, calculations, or simply to display the value. 

For example, you can perform operations like addition, subtraction, and concatenation on variables. 

5. ## Variable Scope: 

Variables have a scope, which defines where in the code they are accessible.
Variables can be local (only accessible in a specific function or block) or global (accessible throughout the entire program). 

6. ## Reassignment: 

You can change the value of a variable by assigning it a new value. This is called reassignment. 

For example, you can do x = 20 to change the value of "x" to 20.
