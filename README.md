# Introduction to Python
Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. 
Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently. 
its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code. 

## Comments 

Comments in Python are used to provide explanations or annotations within your code. 
They are not executed by the Python interpreter and are meant to be human-readable.

##Single-Line Comments: Single-line comments are used for short comments and are preceded by the # symbol.
Everything on the same line after # is considered a comment and is ignored by the Python interpreter. 

This is a single-line comment 
```
 print("Hello, World")  This comment is at the end of a line of code
 
```
 
##Multi-Line Comments or Docstrings: Multi-line comments are typically used for longer explanations and documentation. 
In Python, these are often represented as docstrings (used for documentation of functions, classes, and modules).
A docstring is enclosed in triple quotes (''' or """) and can span multiple lines

````'''
This is a multi-line comment or a docstring.
It can span multiple lines and is often used for documenting functions, classes, or modules.
'''
def my_function():
    """
    This is also a docstring.
    It provides documentation for the function.
    """ ```
    pass
